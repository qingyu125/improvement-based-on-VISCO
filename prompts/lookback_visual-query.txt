You are given an image and a reasoning process around this image. To evaluate the accuracy of the last step, you need to identify information from the image. List all questions necessary to verify against the image.

Detailed instructions:
* Focus only on the last reasoning step. No need to verify visual information from previous steps.
* Each question should focus on verifying visual information from the image, without involving any reasoning.
* Keep questions simple. Break down complex questions into smaller, independent ones.
* Ensure each question can be answered in isolation, without needing context from the reasoning process.
* If the last step does not involve any information from the image, you can respond with N/A.

Your response should be a numbered list as follows:
1. Question 1
